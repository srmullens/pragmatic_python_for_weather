    "## Question #1\n",
    "(30 points) The product you are to create is a map of u-wind anomalies. Studying the u-wind anomalies over oceans is often used to help diagnose the shear within the atmopshere. Here, you'll be investigating the u-wind anomalies for the north Atlantic Ocean.\n",

    "2. (4 point) Subset your domain to be over the Atlantic Ocean (approximately from Brownsville, TX to the west coast of Africa between the equator and Nova Scotia).\n",
    "3. (10 points) Plot the u-wind in units of knots as contours or color-filled contours on a map, which includes at least the state borders. The map extent should match the data subset.\n",

    "## Question #2\n",
    "(30 points) Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are an important feature that explains much about the distribution of temperature, precipitation, and thus vegetation around the globe. Owing to parts of the global circulation, a prominent variation in SSTs occurs in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (off the coast of Peru) that are related to changes in the Southern Oscillation Index and the phenomenon we call El Nino and La Nina. El Nino patterns are associated with warmer than normal (a warm anomaly) within the central or eastern Pacific Ocean along the equator. Your task is in evaluating the development of the warm SST anomalies associated with a significant El Nino event in 1997 by creating some graphics detailed below.\n",

    "   - 1 December 1997\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. (10 points) Plot each day of the anomaly values on a separate axes on one figure (e.g., you should have six subplots) to demonstrate the evolution of the SST anomalies over the course of the year.\n",
    "5. (3 points) Choose an appropriate colormap for viewing anomaly values (a diverging colormap would be most appropriate)\n",
    "6. (5 points) Determine the maximum anomaly for the Eastern Pacific region for each month identified above and report the maximum value for each subplot in its title.\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "* For plotting the anomalies over the Eastern Pacific Ocean, you'll likely want to modify your plot projection to be centered over the international date line (180 degree).\n",
    "* You do NOT have to compute all of the anomaly values before plotting. Make good use of looping and/or definitions to help you be effecient in coding your answer. Part of your score on this question will relate to how effecient your code is in accomplishing the task."
