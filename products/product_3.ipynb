Also determine the number of months that the standardized Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) indicate El Nino conditions (defined for this assignment as SOI <= -1.25) or La Nina conditions (defined for this assignment as SOI >= 1.25). Report the month, year, and SOI value along with the designation of El Nino or La Nina for each individual El Nino or La Nina month. Finally, determine the maximum and minimum value SOI over the entire period, reporting the month and year they occurred in. Print all of the above results to the screen.\n",

    "Generally, an El Nino or La Nina event cannot be determined from any one month of an ENSO index. Instead, the average for a three-month period is often used. However, for simplicity in this assignment, we define an El Nino event when the SOI value is below -1.25 for any particular month and a La Nina event when the SOI value is above 1.25 for any particular month.\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "* Break the problem down into smaller bite-size pieces. For example, first write your program to be able to read in the input file and separate out the year column from the SOI data columns. Then work to find the global max and min values. Then work on finding individual months that can be classified as El Nino, etc.\n",
