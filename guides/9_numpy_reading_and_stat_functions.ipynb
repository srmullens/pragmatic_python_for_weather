    "## Reading in data to Python\n",
    "It is difficult to easily talk about reading data from a file into a Python program simply because there are so many ways to do so! Depending on what the data is and what you want to do with it, there will be a number of different methods to read the file in. Specific to the Numpy module, there are simple read functions, and we are going to use one here. In the future we will use some read functionality from a packaged called Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org) that is in some ways built on top of the Numpy module and brings with it a whole lot of additional functionality. In this example we'll read in an ASCII (plain text) file. We can then use the data to calculate or graph stuff to answer scientific questions! Specifically, the data that we are reading in is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) data from 1950 to 2024.\n",
