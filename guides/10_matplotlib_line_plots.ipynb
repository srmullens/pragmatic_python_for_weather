We will first create a plot using simple examples and work our way up to using values stored in arrays and plotting them.\n",

When we do multiple subplots, each axis will get its own variable like `ax1, ax2`, making the code `ax1.plot(x, y)`."

To save your figure in a particular format, just use the extension on your filename associated with the particular format type. In addition, there are a number of keyword arguments that can be set to alter the look of the saved image. The two that you should commonly use are the `dpi` (dots per inch) setting and `bbox_inches` setting to get rid of excess space surrounding the figure being saved. Note the other way to change the look of your image is by setting the figure size. Making an image larger will help with the resolution."
