    "# Scientific Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Python is great and has been around for 30 years. It first appeared in 1991. The power of python lies within the use of community built modules that lay on top of the core python programming language. These modules are abstract code designed to maximize the usefulness of Object Oriented Programing (OOP) tools by providing advanced functions and methods to the objects in a program. What makes it powerful for scientific applications are the various libararies that have been written to work with scientific (and other) datasets. There is a great [graphic](https://fabienmaussion.info/acinn_python_workshop/figures/scipy_ecosystem.png) developed by Jake Vanderplas in 2015 and reproduced below to illustrate the structure of scientific Python libraries. At the base is the language itself, then the first tier libraries that are built off of the language, then packages that build upon both the language and the first tier libraries, and so on.\n",

    "## Arrays in Python using the Numpy Library\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is a key library used in meteorology. It deals well (and quickly) with array manipulations. Arrays work similar to those in other languages like C++ and Fortran. In Python, they will often feel similar to lists, but the differences can be both advantageous and frustrating. This notebook introduces the numpy module and many of its useful functions, as well as continuing to develop your Python language skills.\n",

    "## Importing Libraries/Modules\n",
    "In order to use a library (or module, or package) within your program you need to first tell the computer to bring it in! The way that this happens is with an import statement. Numpy functions are called with `numpy.function_name()`. This is good because we don't want any similar named functions (e.g., a maximum function) from different modules to overlap! However, it is common to give commonly used modules a handle (or pseudonym) so we can abbreviate it in the code. The common practice is to call the handle for the numpy module \"np\" so we can write `np.function_name()`.\n",
    "In the future, xarray is often abbreviated \"xr\". Matplotlib's pyplot is often abbreviated \"plt\". Statsmodels is often called \"sm\".\n",
